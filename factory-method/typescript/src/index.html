	<p>Troubleshooting:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Did you run "npm install" once then "npm start" after every change?</li>
		<li>Did those commands exit unsuccessfully? If one command fails it might skip over the others but still serve old files successfully.
			<ul>
				<li>Some program claimed a lock on the dist directory so the clean command was failing during testing.  Try closing and reopening anything that might be looking at that page</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Try hard-refreshing your browser</li>
	</ul>
